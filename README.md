# Databricks
Overview

In this notebook i have created and query a table or DataFrame that is uploaded to DBFS. DBFS is a Databricks File System that allows you to store data for querying inside of Databricks. This notebook had a file already inside of DBFS that we would like to read from.

This notebook is written in Python so the default cell type is Python. However, we can use different languages by using the %LANGUAGE syntax. Python, Scala, SQL, and R are all supported.
